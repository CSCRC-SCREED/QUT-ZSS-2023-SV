description: The Datasets contain a wide variety of network and physical behaviours of an IEC-61850-compliant zone substation.
             The datasets are compatible with actual substation network traffic, including benign GOOSE packets, benign SV packets, and MALICIOUS SV packets.
             The datasets consist of two versions, including raw datasets and labelled datasets.
