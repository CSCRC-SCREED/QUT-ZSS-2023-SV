## SV Attack Dataset
The SV attack dataset consists of two versions
1. **Raw dataset**: raw network traffic capture file (\*.pcapng). Rough time period estimation of different behaviours, see "List of Scenarios.xlsx" for details.
2. **Processed dataset**: ready for supervised machine learning (\*.csv & \*.xlsx). The dataset contains the following three datasheets:
- 1) *QUTZS_GOOSE.csv*: extracts all GOOSE features of all GOOSE packets from the raw network traffic 
- 2) *QUTZS_SV.csv*: extracts all SV features of all SV packets from the raw network traffic
- 3) *QUTZS_final.xlsx*: merges both GOOSE and SV features. For every SV packet with APPID "0x4001", within 1.5 times of the SV heartbeat after the packet, the first available SV packet with APPID "0X4002" was appended. After that, according to the closest "packet arrival time", three GOOSE packets (APPIDs "0x3101", "0x3102" and "0x3103") were appended, respectively. Most importantly, each row (merged sample) of the datasheet was labelled based on 39 types of behaviours, including one pure fault-free scenario (label 0), 10 emergency scenarios (labels 101-110), and 28 attack scenarios (labels 911-914, 921-924, 931-934, 941-944, 951-954, 961-964, 971-974).

### Dataset summary
During fault-free operations, from the adversaries’ perspective, the final objective of untrusted Merging Units (MUs) is to interrupt normal energy transmissions. Although untrusted MUs may also harvest secret information, maintain secret remote access, and spread malware to affect more targets, the ultimate goal of a substation attack is to disrupt energy transmissions during fault-free operations after all these preparations. Therefore, during fault-free operations, to achieve this goal in our simulation testbed, we implemented eight attack scenarios 931-934 and 951-954 (addition of fake measurement data or fake messages) and eight attack scenarios 941-944 and 961-964 (modification of measurement data in the original message).

During emergency operations, from the adversaries’ perspective, the final objective of untrusted MUs is stopping designed protection mechanisms and bringing chaos to a substation, such as transformer explosions. Therefore, during emergency operations, to achieve this goal in our simulation testbed, we implemented four attack scenarios 911-914 (addition of fake measurement data or fake messages), four attack scenarios 921-924 (modification of measurement data in the original message), and four attack scenarios 971-974 (deletion of the original message).

In summary, a total of 28 scenarios (911-914, 921-924, 931-934, 941-944, 951-954, 961-964, 971-974) were generated from the testbed. Each scenario consists of different numbers of sub-scenarios, and a total of 168 sub-scenarios were generated in the SV Attack Dataset. The details of each scenario and sub-scenario are discussed in "List of Scenarios.xlsx". 

**Although it is called attack dataset, each sub-scenario not only contains one particular attack behaviour, but also includes non-malicious behaviours, such as 1) fault-free operations when no unusual events happen (labelled as 0), and 2) emergency operations when non-malicious events (e.g., short-circuit faults) happen (labelled as 101-110). In sharp contrast to the mixed behaviours above, 11 additional benign-behaviour-only scenarios were generated. These 11 scenarios include one pure fault-free scenario and 10 emergency scenarios.**
